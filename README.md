### Description

A replacement scheduler tool for windows.. I recently noticed the scheduler is effectively broken in XP (SP2). You now require a logon to schedule a task, and applications scheduled as System with netapi or wmi, are no longer starting. So, I made my own scheduler! This runs with almost no overhead, can schedule multiple simultaneous tasks by hour/day/week/month. Can schedule recurring jobs, and is completely accessable from a command line. This should also run on all operating systems, (let me know..). Well, hope ya like it.. Comments/suggestions are welcome..

----

Updated - Consolidated code into one reusable class. Tightened it up in a few spots, and changed clock display format to 12 hour- AM/PM for clarity.

----

Version 1.3 is up!

Fixed a few problems, added a system tray menu. Skinned the app with Neo Lite.

Enjoy..

Cheers,

John
